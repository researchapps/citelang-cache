Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories.

If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Nucleic repositories.
